### User Interaction Models

#### User Goals

- Think about the primary goals of your interface! 
- Large goals must be broken into smaller goals (usually separated by pages too)
  - <u>Example</u>: Buying a book
    - Subgoal: Find/Select book
    - Subgoal: Add to cart
    - Subgoal: Checkout
- Also, there is an interaction aspect to the page $\rightarrow$ designer must know user's goals

#### Fitt's Law

- Time to move your pointer to a target

$$
a + b \cdot \log\left(\frac{2D}{S}\right)
$$

- The designer creates goals and stuff
- Low-level interactions take a lot of time and effort, minimize the number of those
- Execution vs Evaluation
