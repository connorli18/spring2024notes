# [1/31] UIUX

#### To-Dos:

- Fill out the form to select your section!

#### Javascript, Widget, Events

- Creating interactions on the weg has two parts
  - Program interface
  - Javascript to execute functionality
- Browser's execute HTML file from top to bottom
  - JavaScript will get "hoisted". Meaning, you can use them anywhere in scope. You can list functions below.
  - There is a (worse) way to declare functions that will not be hoisted. 
  - Let is the prefered way to declare variables. 
    - Let is block scoped and can be reassigned
- Only use var when you want a global variable $\rightarrow$ var is globally scoped (var variables can be updated and re-declared)
- Const is good for constant variables
- Include jQuery

- Look at slides!
