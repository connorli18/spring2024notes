# [1/22] UIUX

### Visual Information Design

**Menu:** Reading a menu like a book? Nah. Browsing is more effective - looking for relevant/interesting things.

**Craigslist:** Information Hierarchy, make it more organized.

**Sizing:** Larger, bolder, whitespace text is what you look at first. 

#### Definition

**Introduction:** The main feature of many websites is to display information in a way that helps users accomplish a goal. 

1. What is the user's main goal?
2. What information is displayed to achieve that?

**Example 1:** Columbia Homepage from Google

- Bold titling for the description, Blue URL links, different sections for different links

**Example 2:** Buy a book from Amazon

- Pictures, Titles, Stars

**Example 3:** Educational Video

- The Actual Video Display (60% of Screen), Title, Description, Other Similar Videos (if it's not the correct one)

#### How to Design

- **Undifferentiated Text:** You can pull all the information, but it's not very "readable"
  - Information of different types are put together, not very easy to read!
  - <u>Example:</u> User's Goal is to respond via the information (undifferentiated text does not help)

**Steps to Design:**

1. Group Information into chunks (each separate idea/information gets separated)
2. In each group, emphasize the most important information
   - You are cordially invited to **Robert's Dinner Party**.
3. Step 3, consolidate into a few (3-5) semantically meaningful groups.
   - Wine and nibbles will be served. (not important, so doesn't need a separate group)
4. Use Squint test to see if important information is done. Users can't focus on everything at once, visual heirarhcy of information guides user attention.

**Groups**

1. Conceptual Grouping (for Gmail)
   - (1) 'Your Emails' (2) Sidebar/Menu ... etc.
2. Location Indicates Importance
   - Eyetracking data is upper-left! $\rightarrow$ it must 'Flow in the F Position'
3. Whitespace indicates importance
   - Negative Whitespace often emphasizes something important
4. Size Indicates Importance
   - Primary Action vs Secondary Action $\rightarrow$ primary has a little bit larger
5. Contract indicates Importance (2 ways)
   - **Bold** Increases Contrast
   - **Greyscale** Decreases Contrast
6. Images Indicates Importance
   - An image can make it seem more important $\rightarrow$â€‹ safety and news examples (some articles get images)
7. Color Indicates Importance
   - Lydia is against Color :(

**Analyze Boarding Pass**

- Who is the User?
  - Someone taking a flight to Frankfurt.
- What's the Primary Goal?
  - To get from home to their seat on the plane. The journey starts from home, since the time works.
- Group Analysis
  - Group 1 - stuff you need to know before you leave
    - Flight Number (bolded)
    - Terminal 2 (bolded), Boarding Area D (not as bolded because you need to be at Terminal 2 first)
  - Group 2 - "getting on board" the plane
    - Boarding Time
    - Gate D10
    - Boarding Priority 3 (less emphasized)
  - Group 33 - "on the plane"
    - Seat #
    - Window vs. Aisle
    - Picture (to indicate side, distance, etc.)
- Group 3 Specific (Analysis)
  - What tools did they use to make it good?
    - Use all of them! (or a combination of them)

**Don't Use Color!!!** It's for fucking rookies.

#### Information Foraging Theory

- Why do users not read linearly? Why do they follow visual/textual clues to sense if they are on the right track?
- **Do:** Use Simple labels to guide attention
- Much data is self-labeling, adding labels adds clutter $\rightarrow$ you can get away without labeling things, book titles aren't labeled which is important for minimalism 
- **Do:** Use familiar icons, not unfamiliar icons

#### Summary

- The main feature of many websites is to display information in a way that helps users accomplish goals.
- Users have spotlight of attention. Use visual info hierarchy to guide user attention.
- Seven Tools for visually indicating importance
  - Use multiple tools, use color last
- Info Foraging Theory, users follow textual and visual clues to see if they're on the right track
