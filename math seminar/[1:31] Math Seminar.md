# [1/31] Math Seminar

### Presentation 1 (Jinoo)

#### Resources

<u>Slides</u>: https://www.math.columbia.edu/~avizeff/additive/slides_1.pdf

#### Introduction

- Equivalence Relation
- Equivalence classes are partitioned by determinants
- Quadratic Forms are preserved in equivalence relation

$$
F_a(x_1,x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2  \text{ for the identity matrix}
$$

**Good:**

- Outlining proof is good, saving time and less confusing + more engaging
- I think the slides + organization is very good, it's very easy to follow
- I like how everything is connected

**Bad:**

- Not enough audience engagement
- Timing felt a bit rushed
- It feels like reading off the slides together + narration
